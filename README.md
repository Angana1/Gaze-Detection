# Gaze-Detection
In today’s digital world, access to computer navigation is extremely important for everyone’s holistic growth and development as it ensures independence, agency and a better quality of life. In this project, we use computer vision to combine the digital User Interface with a Gaze-Tracking System to improve tech-penetration among people with disabilities, helping them interact with digital devices with ease.
